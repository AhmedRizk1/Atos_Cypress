                <message>Cypress detected a cross origin error happened on page load:
                
                  > Blocked a frame with origin "https://www.phptravels.net" from accessing a cross-origin frame.
                
                Before the page load, you were bound to the origin policy:
                
                  > https://phptravels.net
                
                A cross origin error happens when your application navigates to a new URL which does not match the origin policy above.
                
                A new URL does not match the origin policy if the 'protocol', 'port' (if specified), and/or 'host' (unless of the same superdomain) are different.
                
                Cypress does not allow you to navigate to a different origin URL within a single test.
                
                You may need to restructure some of your test code to avoid this problem.
                
                Alternatively you can also disable Chrome Web Security in Chromium-based browsers which will turn off this restriction by setting { chromeWebSecurity: false } in `/Users/ahmedrizk/Desktop/Cypress/CypressProject/Atos_Cypress/cypress.json`.
